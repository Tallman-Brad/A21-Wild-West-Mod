= Making a World for the Wild West Mod using the 7D2D Random World Generator =
==============================================================================

Here are some instructional steps on how to make a RWG World for the Wild West Mod using the in game World creator.
By following these instructions, your World will provide total Wild West Mod immersion and remove innapropriate assets.

1.It is necessary to use '0-SphereII Legacy Distant Terrain' Mod when loading/joining an in game RWG World.
This is because it removes 'Asphalt' and replaces it with 'Gravel' for the tracks and paths.
It is added to the clientside Mods folder. It is not necessary to add it to the server.
It can be downloaded here: https://github.com/SphereII/SphereII.Mods

2. Telrics Horses Mod (TelricsHorses2.0A20) is necessary for the Wild West Mod as it provides immersive transporation.
It is bundled into the Wild West Mod package witout any change to its original release.
A patch will load after Telrics Horses Mod to make a few changes.
Telrics Horses Mod contains 1 POI called MaybellsFarm which will be innapropriate for players who want total immersion.
It is necessary to remove this POI (6 individual files named MaybellsFarm) from the TelricsHorses2.0A20 Prefabs folder.
This will ensure it doesn't get placed on the World when using RWG.
For players who would like to see this POI, it is not necessary to remove it.

3. Default 7D2D POIs are not necessary for the Wild West Mod due to modern features.
Go to your default 7D2D main directory. In the Data / Prefabs folder, delete the POIs folder (after making a backup).
This will ensure no regular POIs are placed into the World when using RWG.
Any necesssary POIs such as iron ore 'nuggets' or decorative POIs have already been bundled into the Wild West Mod. 

4. Generate a RWG World using the game World Generator.
It is recommended to set 50% Desert Biome, and share the remainder between Pine Forest, Snow, and Wasteland.
It is necessary to have all Biomes on a World since certain game features require visiting them for resources and quests.
It is recommended to set Towns to many and leave Wilderness at Default or Few.

= What to expect from a Wild West Mod World from RWG =
======================================================
The RWG will only spawn the Old West Tiling system. However, it has been specifically modified for the Wild West Mod.
The 'Wild West Towns' will be populated by an abundance of custom POIs from Tier 1 to Tier 3 with the odd placement for Tier 4 and 5.
You may recognise some of the POIs as they are conversions of TFP Old West and Cabin type POIs. These have all been stripped of modern assets and given replacements.
You will see a variety of custom POIs in the Wilderness. These range from Tier 1 to Tier 5. Tier 4 and 5 will be in greater abundance in the Wilderness.
There will be Trader Hugh or Joel in every 'Wild West Town' at the Gateway area.
There will also be a customised Travelling Trader Hugh POI and Rekt POI in the Wilderness.
You will also find some custom decorative POIs spawning in the Wilderness that provide a cosmetic update and access to resources.

By following Steps 1, 2, 3 and 4, the Wild West Mod will offer a highly immersive addition to the collection of Overhauls and Mods available to enhance the 7D2D experience.
